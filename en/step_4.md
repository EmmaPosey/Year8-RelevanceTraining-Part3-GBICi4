## Task 1: Technical setup for the trial

Check that you are prepared for the trial. This step is the first in a series of tasks in order to ensure that the technical setup is arranged well in advance of delivering the lessons.

**Devices and live demonstrations**
Ideally, all demonstrations of programming should be done live. Set up well in advance of delivering the lessons as you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware. 

**App Lab** is an online tool which runs on desktop computers as well as tablets/iPad. Check that App Lab runs on each device which you are planning to use in the trial.

You should consider the practicalities of demonstration when creating the seating plan. There are real benefits to live demonstration. In advance of the demonstrations, we recommend that you practise modifying and creating the programs in App Lab that are referenced in the sessions. However, if live demonstration is not practical, each session offers students a step-by-step guide as an alternative to live demonstration. 

For all activities in these sessions, pupils will work independently as well as sometimes in groups for discussion and idea development purposes. Organise pupils' seating in advance to allow for groups.
