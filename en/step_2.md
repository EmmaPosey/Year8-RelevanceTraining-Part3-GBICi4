## Task 2: What's App Lab?
Now that you have set up App Lab logins for you and your students, you can familiarise yourself with Session 6, an introductory session on App Lab. It is the same session that the pupils themselves will undertake as an introduction. You will then create your own simple app, with user interaction, which addresses a real-world issue.

--- task ---

Open [Session 1](https://ncce.io/xBrv1w), which comprises of the teacher-facing 'Lesson Primer', 'Lesson Plan', 'Teacher Slides' and the 'App Lab Login Guide' (which you were introduced to in the previous task). The session folder also includes the student facing 'Student Checklist' and 'Getting Started with App Lab'. Through the session you will be introduced to the AppLab interface, including blocks. Familiarise yourself with the 'Lesson Primer' and 'Lesson Plan' first. Then, using the 'Teacher Slides' and 'Getting Started with App Lab' guide, take yourself through the session.

Session 6 sets the scene for sessions 7 to 11.

Now practise modifying and developing your program in App Lab using [sessions 7 to 11](https://ncce.io/GLAm98) as a reference. Leave yourself plenty of exploration and development time to realise your app ideas into a working app.
