You will be using App Lab to teach key programming concepts in the production of an app for a mobile device. Learners need not be familiar with programming at the start of the trial. Educators should be familiar with App Lab. Detailed instructions for completing each task are provided in the Lesson Primer so that educators who are less familiar with App Lab are able to practice in advance when preparing for the lessons. Session 2 focuses on building up your expertise in App Lab and your familiarity with the resources.

You can see in the Units Overview that the resources comprise of 12-sessions. Each session gradually introduces learners to app idea development focusing on a real-world issue. From Session 6, pupils are introduced to the App Lab environment and related blocks that can be used to construct their app. Over the course of the rest of the sessions, pupils explore the programming concepts of sequencing, selection and repetition to produce an app of their choice.
