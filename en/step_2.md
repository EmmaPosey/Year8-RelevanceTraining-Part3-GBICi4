## Task 2: What's App Lab?
Now that you have set up App Lab logins for you and your students, you can familiarise yourself with Session 6, an introductory session on App Lab. It is the same session that the pupils themselves will undertake as an introduction. You will then create your own simple app, with user interaction, which addresses a real-world issue.

--- task ---

Open [Session 6](https://ncce.io/xBrv1w){:target="_blank"} and familiarise yourself with the 'Lesson Primer' and 'Lesson Plan' first. Then, using the 'Teacher Slides' and 'Getting Started with App Lab' guide, take yourself through the session. You will find in the session folder the 'App Lab Login Guide' which you were introduced to in the previous task. During the session you will be introduced to the AppLab interface, including some blocks.  

--- /task ---

Session 6 sets the scene for sessions 7 and 8 which introduce new blocks in order to develop your app further using graphics, sound and user interaction throughevent-driven programming.

--- task ---

Now practise modifying and developing your skills in App Lab using [sessions 7 and 8](https://ncce.io/GLAm98){:target="_blank"} as a reference. 

Continuing to program in App Lab will help you develop your subject-knowledge as well as your confidence in delivering live demonstrations in class. You will also have experienced the sessions from the pupils' perspective which will help when giving support in the sessions.
