## Task 5: Post-training webinar

The 'Relevance' post-training webinar was based on the information in Task 4. Even if you attended the post-training webinar, it is recommended that you work your way through the video recording and/or slide deck to remind yourself of the key questions, the FAQs (frequently asked questions), the feedback mechanisms, and how to engage with the trial community.
