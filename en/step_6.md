## Resourcess
Now that you have read the App Development Sceme of Work (SoW) and undertaken Session 6, you should take time within this session to familiarise yourself with the App Lab tasks included in the other App Lab focused sessions: 7 to 11. You will continue to program in App Lab. Completing the main tasks in these sessions will help you develop your subject-knowledge and your confidence in delivering live demonstrations. You will also have experienced the sessions from the pupils' perspective which will help when giving support in the sessions. 

--- task ---

Take time now to access and explore sessions 7 to 11. Each session always includes the following resources: Lesson Primer, Lesson Plan, Teacher Slides and Student Checklist. These are outline further below. In some sessions you will also find session-specific documents.

**Lesson Primer**
All the Lesson Primers are structured in a consistent way with the following subheadings:
+ What you need to know about running this lesson: practical issues, documents required, and activity timings.
+ Key information and terminology
+ Assessment questions
+ Extension tasks
+ Further reading

**Lesson Plan**
The '5 Minute' Lesson Plan enables teachers to visualise the lesson. The one-page diagram includes: 
+ The BIG Picture
+ Objectives
+ Engagement
+ Key messages
+ AfL
+ Differentiation
+ Key words
+ Learning episodes - identifying whether these are teacher or student-led

**Lesson Slides**
All the lesson slides are structured in a consistent way, beginning with a reminder of the last session, the current session objectives and the activities the students will undertake. This introduction is followed by the session activities. At the end of the session, the slides always include the following: students review their progress, are reminded again about the session contents and details about the focus of the next session.

Work your way through each session, exploring the Lesson Plan and its correlation to the Teacher Slides. Allowing yourself time for preparation now will make it easier to incorporate the 'Relevance' intervention into your lessons when the trial begins. 

**Student Checklist**
The one-page student-facing table enables students to tick off the tasks in this session as they complete them. It acts as a reminder and acts as a progression map.

Now consider how you can practically best implement the 'Relevance' intervention in your own classroom with your students.

Make a note of anything that you need to clarify. You can use the feedback form to ask questions to the trial community. You can also get in touch with us by email if you have any queries at any time before, during, or after the trial via [genderresearch@raspberrypi.org](mailto:genderresearch@raspberrypi.org).

In the next session, Session 3, you will develop an understanding of the correlation between App Lab and the idea development process in sessions 1 to 5.
