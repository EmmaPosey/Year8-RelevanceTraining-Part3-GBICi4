## Part 2: Year 8 Relevance Training - Getting started
Part 2 introduces you to the online Relevance resources through links, video and tasks. There are two tasks in this session. The second task focuses on completing a lesson that the pupils themselves undertake.

## Accessing the Relevance resources
In this session, you are going to focus on the lesson resources you will need for the Relevance trial. You will have an opportunity to explore all the resources for yourself, try them out and think about how to implement the lessons in your own classroom.

The session introduces you to the [Relevance Resource portal](NEED LINK) where you can explore all the resources for Session 1 to 12. The webpage is the access portal for all the resources relating to the Relevance trial. Here you can follow links to Google Docs and Google Slides OR download the resources as Microsoft documents.

Links to all of the resources can also be found in your [Project Guide](LINK NEEDED), [Unit Overview](LINK NEEDED) and also accessed via the [Google Drive](LINK NEEDED).

The resources consist of one sub-folder (with the 12 sessions) and three documents. Feel free to download the resources or access them each time you need them from this webpage. You may wish to bookmark the link to the resources in the browser toolbar of the teacherâ€™s tablet/iPad/computer for ease of reference.

The resources prepared for the trial period include twelve 1-hour lessons. You will implement the teaching approach within fully-resourced lessons: six weeks on Story-writing and six weeks on Digital Storytelling.
