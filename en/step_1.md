## Part 3: Year 8 Relevance Training - Investigating App Lab
Part 3 introduces you to the remainder of the Relevance resources which focus on App Lab. There are five tasks in this part. In the second and third tasks you will focus on completing a series of sessions on App Lab that the pupils themselves undertake.

## Task 1: Technical setup for the trial

Before you begin developing your skills in App Lab you need to check that you and your classroom are prepared for the trial. This task, Task 1, aims to ensure that the technical setup is arranged well in advance of delivering the lessons as you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware.

**Seating plan**
You will need to consider live demonstrations when organising pupils' seating. You should also consider the practicalities of group discussions when creating the seating plan. For all activities in these sessions, pupils will work independently as well as sometimes get in to groups for discussion and idea development purposes.

Ideally, all demonstrations of programming should be done live as there are real benefits for the learner. Demonstrations offer students the opportunity to experience how to navigate the App Lab interface and how to interact with it to select and interlock blocks. If live demonstrations are not practical, each session offers students a step-by-step guide. In the following two tasks you will focus on completing a series of sessions on App Lab to build your expertise and confidence.
