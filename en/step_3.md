## Task 3: Build  your app

In this task you will be developing your app design, a technical prototype, through **flowcharts** and **pseudocode** to help to think through what the prototype needs to do and to break the requirements down into manageable steps.

Work through [Session 9](ncce.io/0Ajo8a), again using the Teacher Slides and Student Worksheets. Ensure you can reiterate the benefits of structuring the flow of user interaction in flowcharts and preempting which blocks are needed and in what sequence using pseudocode. Students often want to bypass the groundwork of flowcharts and pseudocode in order to get straight on to programming their app only to come across issues when programming.

With the guidance of the Teacher Slides and Student Worksheets in [Session 10](https://ncce.io/oYe7gu) and [Session 11](https://ncce.io/QIk58r), now build your app. Leave yourself plenty of exploration and development time to realise your app ideas into a working app. You will share you app with your peers for feedback as well as share it  with the GBIC team and use it as an example when delivering the trial to the students.
