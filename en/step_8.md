Even if you attended the post-training webinar, it is recommended that you work your way through the embedded video recording and/or slide deck to remind yourself of the key questions, the FAQs (frequently asked questions), the feedback mechanisms, and how to engage with the trial community. If you would like to watch the recording, please see the video below:
